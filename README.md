# Analyzing Popularity of Programming Languages in R

![Cover image](AnalysingPopPLs/prog_lang.jpg)

Using the Tidyverse to discover insight on the popularity of programming languages using data obtained from Stack Overflow. [Link to DataCamp project](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2557)

## About the dataset

Â Stack Overflow is a programming question-and-answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. Each Stack Overflow question is tagged with a label identifying its topic or technology. The data used in this project comes from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer; it contains one observation per tag per year, including the number of questions for that tag and the total number of questions that year.

## Objective of the project

**Objective 1:** What was the percentage of R questions for 2020? Save the result in a data frame, r_2020, containing five columns: year, tag, num_questions, year_total, and percentage.

**Objective 2:** Identify the five programming language tags with the highest total number of questions asked between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive). Save the tag names as highest_tags.

## Tools used

- readr
- dplyr
- ggplot2
